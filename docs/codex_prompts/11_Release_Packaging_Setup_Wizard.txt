You are Codex working in this repository.

READ FIRST:
- Follow AGENTS.md strictly.
- Preserve premium UI system (schedule.css and shared UI includes).
- Do NOT refactor working logic.
- This task is packaging + onboarding + demo tooling + docs, not core logic changes.

GOAL:
Make the scheduling module “ready to sell” and easy to deploy:
1) Setup Wizard (first-run) so new restaurants can start scheduling in minutes
2) Demo Mode + seed data (optional, safe)
3) Sales/Compare page (feature matrix + proof artifacts)
4) Deployment checklist for shared hosting + cron + storage hardening
5) Zero future styling rework — use existing UI components everywhere

SCOPE:
- Add new files under /schedule, /docs, /scripts (or /tools)
- Minimal surgical edits to add nav links
- Add migrations only if needed (additive only)

========================================================
1) SETUP WIZARD (FIRST-RUN EXPERIENCE)
========================================================
Create: /schedule/setup.php (manager-only)

Purpose:
- Detect if scheduling is “not configured” for this restaurant:
  - no roles exist OR no policy set exists OR permissions missing
- Provide a guided setup:
  Step 1: Confirm restaurant timezone (store in an existing settings table if present;
          otherwise create a tiny table schedule_settings).
  Step 2: Create default roles/stations (FOH/BOH templates):
          - Server, Host, Bartender, Expo, Runner, Dishwasher, Line Cook, Prep Cook, Manager
          User can add/remove.
  Step 3: Create default policy set (rules engine) and set as default
  Step 4: Grant schedule permissions:
          - make current user a schedule manager for this restaurant
  Step 5: Optional: enable Aloha integration mode (CSV import) and show link

Requirements:
- Must not crash if settings tables are missing.
- Use CSRF on forms.
- Premium UI using schedule.css.
- Do not assume global admin; just restaurant scope.

If a settings table does not exist, add migration:
- /migrations/031_schedule_settings.sql
schedule_settings:
  - id PK
  - restaurant_id unique
  - timezone varchar(64) default 'America/New_York'
  - demo_mode tinyint default 0
  - created_at datetime

========================================================
2) DEMO MODE + SEED DATA (SAFE, OPTIONAL)
========================================================
Create:
- /docs/DEMO_MODE.md
- /scripts/seed_schedule_demo.php  (CLI and/or web-trigger safe)
- Optional: /migrations/032_demo_seed_optional.sql (ONLY if your repo uses migrations for seed; otherwise script only)

Demo mode rules:
- Demo mode must be PER-RESTAURANT (schedule_settings.demo_mode=1).
- The seed script should:
  - Create a few roles if missing
  - Create a few staff members ONLY if safe:
    - If staff_members schema is uncertain, do NOT insert there.
    - Instead create demo staff in a new table schedule_demo_staff and map internally only for demo.
  - Create 2 weeks of shifts (some open shifts)
  - Create 1–2 time-off requests
  - Create 1 announcement
  - Create 1 callout and 1 pending pickup request if those tables exist
- Add “Reset Demo Data” option (danger confirm) that deletes only demo-tagged rows for that restaurant.

Implementation approach:
- Add a column is_demo tinyint default 0 to your schedule-owned tables ONLY IF safe and additive.
  If altering many tables is risky, use a separate demo_tag table:
  - demo_tags: restaurant_id, entity_type, entity_id
  and delete based on tags.
Prefer minimal-risk approach.

========================================================
3) SALES/COMPARE PAGE (PROOF + MATRIX)
========================================================
Create: /schedule/compare.php (manager-only; or owner-only if roles exist)

This is NOT a marketing lie page; it is a structured checklist:
- Section A: “Core Scheduling Parity” (templates, swaps, time-off, messaging, notifications, labor actuals)
- Section B: “Better Than Typical Schedulers” (quality score, marketplace, triggers, compliance dashboard, punch exceptions)
- Section C: “Proof” buttons/links:
  - link to Compliance page, Quality score, Labor actuals, Notifications
  - show counts for last 7 days: swaps, callouts, pickup approvals, violations (if tables exist)

Comparison matrix design:
- Columns:
  - HospiEdge Scheduler (Yes)
  - Typical Scheduling Tools (Often / Sometimes / Rarely)
DO NOT name specific competitors to avoid inaccurate claims.
Keep text conservative and factual:
- “Quality score tied to compliance + audits” -> Rarely
- “Incident/temp triggers to staffing actions” -> Rarely
- “Audit-ready compliance evidence pack” -> Rarely
If unsure, label as “Differentiator” instead of claiming competitor absence.

Premium UI requirement.

========================================================
4) DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST (Namecheap shared hosting friendly)
========================================================
Create docs:
- /docs/DEPLOY_schedule_checklist.md
Include:
- Required PHP version notes (whatever repo uses)
- Running migrations (phpMyAdmin instructions)
- Cron setup:
  - run jobs/worker.php every 5 minutes
  - optional manual run_once
- Storage hardening:
  - where CSV uploads are stored
  - ensure folder is not executable and not publicly browsable
  - include .htaccess deny rules if Apache
Create:
- /storage/imports/.htaccess (if Apache) with Deny from all or equivalent.
If Nginx environment is possible, document alternative.

========================================================
5) FINAL NAV + UX TOUCHES (NO RESTYLE)
========================================================
- Add links (manager-only) in schedule nav:
  - Setup
  - Compare
  - Jobs (if jobs admin exists)
- Add a small “System Status” card somewhere (Setup or Compare):
  - Cron worker last run time (if stored)
  - Aloha enabled yes/no
  - Demo mode yes/no
If no “last run time” exists, add in schedule_settings:
  - last_worker_run_at datetime nullable
and update in worker.php when it runs successfully (tiny edit).

========================================================
6) VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)
========================================================
- php -l on every new/edited PHP file.
- Manual checks:
  - setup.php runs on empty DB and creates defaults safely
  - compare.php loads and shows feature checklist and proof links
  - demo seed can run (or is safely blocked if schema unknown)
  - deploy checklist is accurate for this repo structure
  - storage folder is protected (not web accessible)

STOP CONDITION:
- Setup wizard exists and gets a new restaurant ready fast.
- Demo mode exists and is safe (no breaking assumptions).
- Compare page exists and is conservative + helpful.
- Deployment checklist exists.
- Premium UI preserved; no unrelated refactors.
